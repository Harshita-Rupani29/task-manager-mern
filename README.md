# Task Manager MERN Application

This project is a simple Task Manager application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Download and install from [MongoDB Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshita-rupani29/task-manager-mern.git
cd task-manager-mern
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Backend

Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection URI.

### 4. Run the Application

#### Backend

Navigate to the `backend` folder and start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend
